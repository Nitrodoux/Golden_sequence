# Generator of golden sequences

This project generates golden sequences, for example Fibbonacci's sequence. User can set two initial elements and how many elements sequention contains. Subsequent elements and ratio of them are displayed. You can see that ratio of subsequent elements is going to be "golden ration" (1.618 033 988) when number of elements increase. You can change color of elements which value is even or odd, ratio and all of them!

This project uses methods and attributes of DOM. For example creates handles and creates and triggers events by various methods, catches collections of elements and loops on them, uses arrow functions.
